# Python-File-Analyser
This project has been a deep dive into software development, offering us a chance to refine our Java programming skills and explore Python file analysis. While designing a game could have been more engaging, this project instilled in us practical, industry-relevant skills.

We developed an application that rigorously inspects Python scripts, reinforcing good coding standards important in collaborative settings. Our enhanced Java skills, new-found proficiency in CLI and GUI development, and ability to tackle technical challenges like multi-option CLI commands are testaments to our growth.

The user-friendly GUI facilitates easy application interaction, providing directory statistics and Python file listings. Leveraging resources like YouTube tutorials, we surmounted the steep learning curve of new development practices.

Ultimately, this project was more than just codingâ€”it was about teamwork, problem-solving, and creating practical tools, setting a strong foundation for future ventures in software development.
